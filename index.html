            <h2>4. Who is ST. LAWRENCE?</h2>
            <img src="ST.jpg" alt="Image of ST Lawrence">
            <p>Lawrence (Latin laurentius, literally “laurelled”) is the name of the archdeacon of the church of Rome who was martyred (a person who is killed because of their religious or other beliefs) in Rome in the year 258 during the persecution of Christians ordered by the Emperor Valerian. In the century after his martyrdom, devotion to this St. Lawrence developed rapidly and far beyond Rome. The saint was tied on top of an iron grill over a slow fire that roasted him. God gave him so much strength and joy that Lawrence joked with the judge saying "Turn me over". Before he died, he prayed that the city of Rome might be converted to Jesus. He prayed that the Catholic faith would spread all over the world.</p>

			<h2>8. Why do Anglican priests wear robes?</h2>

				<h2>9. The sacred vessels used in the celebration of the Holy Communion service are:</h2>
				<p>The chalice, the paten, the ciborium or pyx(Another name for ciborium), the flagon, the spoon, the water and wine cruets, and the lavabo bowl. The last three vessels are not used everywhere. If possible, all the vessels, with the exception of the wine cruets and the lavabo bowl, should be sterling silver lined with gold. They may also be solid gold and richly ornamented. Some contemporary ornamentation in enamel is very good.

		<h3>Chalice</h3>
		The chalice is the single cup that our Lord blessed and from which all drank when He instituted the Sacrament of the Altar. The chalice also is called the cup of blessing, the cup of the Lord, the common cup, and the Communion cup.
			<center><img src = 'chalice2.jpg' height = '50%' width = '10%'></center>

		<h3>Paten</h3>
		The paten is the plate for the bread. The paten is made to fit into the mouth or rim of the chalice and large enough so that it can be used for the distribution. It is the symbol of the “one bread” broken into pieces. These pieces are called wafers or hosts.
			<center><img src = 'paten.jpg' height = '50%' width = '15%'></center>
		<h3>Ciborium or Pyx</H3>
		The ciborium and the pyx are containers for additional wafers. The ciborium has the shape of a covered chalice and the pyx that of a round covered box, also called a host box. Sometimes the ciborium is used for the distribution in place of the paten, but in that case the paten is still used for the consecration.
			<center><img src = 'ciburium.jpg' height = '50%' width = '15%'></center>
		<h3>Flagon</h3>
		The flagon is a container for additional wine. Large cruets (see below) are sometimes used in place of a flagon.
			<center><img src = 'flagon.jpg' height = '50%' width = '15%'></center>
		<h3>Spoon</h3>
		The spoon is used for the removal of pieces of cork or other matter that may have fallen into the wine. It is needed only very rarely.
		<center><img src = 'spoon.jpg' height = '50%' width = '15%'></center>
		<h3>Cruet</h3>
		The cruet is a glass container for water or wine, with a stopper in the shape of a cross. Wine cruets used in place of a flagon are usually much larger than water cruets. A water cruet is used for pouring a little water into the chalice where the traditional mixed chalice (wine mixed with a little water) is retained and where the celebrant cleanses or purifies the chalice and paten ceremonially after the distribution. It is also used with the lavabo ceremony.
		<center><img src = 'chalice2.jpg' height = '50%' width = '15%'></center>
		<h3>Lavabo Bowl & Lavabo Towel</h3>
		The lavabo bowl holds the water for the ceremonial cleansing of the celebrant’s fingers after the offerings of the people (including the bread and wine) are placed on the altar, the finger's are wiped with the lavabo Towel.. The ceremony is purely symbolic and is connected with the words of Psalm 26:6–7: “I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, O Lord, proclaiming thanksgiving aloud, and telling all your wondrous deeds.”</p>
