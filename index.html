            <h2>Who is ST LAWRENCE?</h2>
            <img src="ST.jpg" alt="Image of ST Lawrence">
            <p>Lawrence (Latin laurentius, literally “laurelled”) is the name of the archdeacon of the church of Rome who was martyred (a person who is killed because of their religious or other beliefs) in Rome in the year 258 during the persecution of Christians ordered by the Emperor Valerian. In the century after his martyrdom, devotion to this St. Lawrence developed rapidly and far beyond Rome. The saint was tied on top of an iron grill over a slow fire that roasted him. God gave him so much strength and joy that Lawrence joked with the judge saying "Turn me over". Before he died, he prayed that the city of Rome might be converted to Jesus. He prayed that the Catholic faith would spread all over the world.</p>
