# ST.-Lawrence-Prayers
The website we just developed is about ST. Lawrence, focusing on providing a study guide related to his life and various aspects of Christian faith and practice. It includes the following sections:

Who is ST. Lawrence?: Information about St. Lawrence, his martyrdom, and his significance in Christian history.
The 14 Stations of the Cross: A detailed list and description of the traditional 14 Stations of the Cross, which depict the events of Jesus' last day.
The Rules and Aims of the Server's Guild: An outline of the rules and aims for members of the Server's Guild, emphasizing respect, punctuality, and comfort for the needy.
Sacraments of the Church: An explanation of the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church, categorized into Sacraments of Initiation, Sacraments of Healing, and Sacraments at the Service of Communion.
Additionally, the website features a link to a test page ("Test your knowledge"), which is intended to help users assess their understanding of the content provided in the guide. The test page currently has a placeholder message indicating that the test will be available next week.

The design of the website includes a visually appealing background with a gradient, a header image of ST. Lawrence, and various images relevant to the content of each section.
